## Saleswhale FrontEnd Assignment
A mockup page from one of Saleswhale's applications. Tasked to implement this React app to look as close as possible to it and also have other multiple functionalities

### Tasks
* Design layout page
* Specific teams display on corresponding tab functionality

### Steps taken
* Studied how the layout design from the figma mockup looks like and initially decide to how many components is needed
* Started coding the layout of the page with 5 initial components for the Side Navigation bar, Top Navigation Bar, Header, Teams & Activities
* After implementing the 5 components, decided to make more smaller components of the initial main components
* Also added functions in some of the child components such as fetching data from the mock API and for displaying teams in specific tabs
* After being satisfied with the layout of the project, added some responsive designs for smaller screens
* Later added the functions to the parent component, App.js, so that it will only pass down states of the data and the children components will only render

### Deployment
* Deployed the main project in Github pages : https://vexuas.github.io/sw-frontend-assignment/
* Deployed the mock api using json-server in heroku : https://sw-assigment-mock-api.herokuapp.com/
